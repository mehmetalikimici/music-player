# Music-Player

I created a music player site. In the design, I implemented the dynamics with JavaScript along with CSS.<br>

As seen in the design, there are start, stop, forward, backward, shuffle and loop buttons and I activated these buttons with javascript.
With the bar at the bottom, I made it possible to listen to the songs at any time and added time counters that show the length of the songs.
Finally, I completed the song player by adding the song list to the project in JSON format.
